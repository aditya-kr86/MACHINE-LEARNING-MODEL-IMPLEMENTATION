## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `smart_spam_detector.ipynb`  
  An interactive Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the complete pipeline for building a spam email classifier using NLP and machine learning.

---

## üì® Example Project: Smart Spam Detector

This project walks through the process of creating a predictive model to classify SMS/email messages as spam or not spam. The notebook contains:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  Handles text normalization, stopword removal, and lemmatization with NLTK.
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization (including bigrams) to transform text into features.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
  Trains and compares Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classifiers.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Uses GridSearchCV for optimizing Logistic Regression.
- **Performance Visualization:**  
  Includes confusion matrix and ROC curve plots.
- **Custom Prediction:**  
  Lets you test the trained model on new messages.
- **Model Export:**  
  Saves the trained vectorizer and classifier for later use.

**Notebook:**

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aditya-kr86/MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION.git
   cd MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Create a virtual environment, install the following manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk joblib
   ```

3. **Download NLTK Data:**  
   In your notebook or Python shell, ensure required NLTK resources are downloaded:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `smart_spam_detector.ipynb` in your browser.
